  üéØ Summary

  Overall Progress: 0% - All stories NOT_STARTED

  Critical Path to Completion:
  1. Story #126 (User Auth) - Foundation for everything
  2. Story #127 (Admin Management) - Manage users
  3. Story #133 (API Auth) - Secure the APIs
  4. Story #123 (Logout/Sessions) - Complete auth flow
  5. Story #125 (Email Invites) - Onboarding
  6. Story #122 (Profile) - User self-service
  7. Story #124 (Audit Logs) - Security monitoring

  Dependencies to check: Stories #118, #119, #120 (referenced but not in your list)

  Before implementing these stories, I need to know about the email service for backup notifications. Would you like me to:
  1. Set up email notifications using a service (which one?)
  2. Start implementing the authentication stories?

  Todos
  [ ] Add email notification to backup script for 24 hours
  [ ] Create end-of-day backup summary email after 24 hours
  [√ó] Review stories 126, 133, 127, 123, 122, 124, 125
  [ ] Analyze what's done vs not done for each story
  [ ] Report findings back to user

  üìã UPDATED Story Analysis - Now Including #146

  Story #146 - Jinal's BubbleUp Integration Requirements ‚≠ê NEW PRIORITY

  - Priority: MEDIUM | Effort: 8 | Value: 9
  - Status: NOT_STARTED
  - Created by: Mark Weston (gmail account)
  - Assigned to: Mark Weston (regulativ.ai account)
  - Epic: API Integration

  What Jinal needs (from technical notes):

  CRITICAL (Items 4, 5, 6):
  1. Database Schema - Table names, column structure, constraints
  2. API Endpoints Documentation - Full API reference for all CRUD operations
  3. Authentication Flow - Token type, refresh mechanism, expiration handling

  ALREADY HAVE (Items 1, 2, 3):
  - ‚úÖ Supabase Project URL
  - ‚úÖ Project Reference ID
  - ‚úÖ Jinal's credentials (email, password, UUID)

  NICE TO HAVE (Items 7, 8, 9):
  - RLS policies documentation
  - Swagger/OpenAPI spec
  - Rate limiting details

  ---
  üéØ Revised Priority Order

  Given Jinal is blocked, Story #146 should be done FIRST:

  1. Story #146 (Jinal's Integration Needs) - BLOCKING JINAL ‚ö†Ô∏è
  2. Story #126 (User Auth) - Foundation
  3. Story #127 (Admin Management)
  4. Story #133 (API Auth with RBAC)
  5. Story #123 (Logout/Sessions)
  6. Story #125 (Email Invites)
  7. Story #122 (Profile Management)
  8. Story #124 (Audit Logs)

  Would you like me to:
  1. Create the documentation for Jinal (Story #146) - database schema, API endpoints, auth flow
  2. Set up email notifications for backups (your original request)
  3. Both in parallel

-----------------------

Recommended Implementation Order:

  1. Story 126 - Login/Register pages (foundation, no dependencies)
  2. Story 123 - Logout (quick, builds on 126)
  3. Story 133 - API auth (critical for security)
  4. Story 127 - Admin dashboard (unblocks other stories)
  5. Story 125 - Email invites (nodemailer ready)
  6. Story 122 - Profile page (user experience)
  7. Story 124 - Audit logs (lowest value)
