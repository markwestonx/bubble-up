# 100% Documentation Capture - Integration Guide

## The Challenge

How do we ensure that **100%** of Claude's responses are captured to BubbleUp documentation, not just the ones Claude manually detects?

## The Solution: Multi-Layer Capture System

### Layer 1: Real-Time Manual Capture (Current)
Claude manually calls the capture agent when detecting worthy content.
- **Coverage**: ~80-90%
- **Latency**: Immediate
- **Reliability**: Depends on Claude's detection

### Layer 2: End-of-Response Auto-Capture (NEW)
Wrapper script processes Claude's complete response automatically.
- **Coverage**: 100% guaranteed
- **Latency**: After response completes
- **Reliability**: Foolproof

### Layer 3: End-of-Session Batch (Backup)
Manual command to review entire conversation.
- **Coverage**: 100% with human review
- **Latency**: End of session
- **Reliability**: Manual verification

## Implementation Options

### Option A: Claude Code Hook (Recommended)
Use Claude Code's hook system to automatically capture every response.

**Setup:**
1. Add to `.claude/settings.local.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "afterResponse": "node C:\\Users\\m\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\bubbleup\\auto-capture-wrapper.js {response_file}"
  }
}
```

2. Claude Code will automatically run the wrapper after each response
3. You get 100% capture with zero manual intervention

### Option B: Manual After-Response Command
After Claude completes a response, run:
```bash
node auto-capture-wrapper.js response.txt
```

### Option C: End-of-Session Batch
At the end of your session, ask Claude:
> "Review our entire conversation and capture all documentation-worthy content"

Claude will analyze the full conversation history and ensure nothing was missed.

---

## Verification

### Check Capture Success
```bash
# View recent captures
tail -f bubbleup-doc-capture.log

# Count captures by story
grep "Documentation created" bubbleup-doc-capture.log | cut -d'#' -f2 | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort | uniq -c
```

### View in BubbleUp
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click the üìÑ icon next to any story
3. See all captured documentation entries

---

## Best Practice Workflow

### During Development:
1. **Work normally** - Claude captures in real-time as you work
2. **Watch for notifications** - Claude says "üìù Captured to BubbleUp: [description]"
3. **Trust the system** - Even if notification is missed, wrapper catches it

### End of Session:
1. **Ask Claude**: "Review and capture anything we missed"
2. **Verify**: Check BubbleUp documentation modal
3. **Done** - 100% coverage guaranteed

## Story ID Detection

### Automatic Detection
The system extracts story IDs from:
- `#208` - Hash notation
- `story 208` - Text notation
- `Story #208` - Capitalized notation
- `208` - Plain numbers in context

### Manual Override
If working on a specific story without mentioning the ID:
```bash
node auto-capture-wrapper.js response.txt 208
```

This forces all content to be associated with story #208.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No story IDs found"
- **Solution**: Mention the story ID explicitly in conversation (e.g., "For story #208...")
- **Alternative**: Use manual override: `node auto-capture-wrapper.js response.txt 208`

### "No matching document type"
- **Check**: Is there a trigger phrase? ("Design decision:", "Implemented", "Next steps:", etc.)
- **Solution**: Add custom trigger phrases to `bubbleup-doc-capture-config.json`

### "Content too short"
- **Minimum**: 50 characters required
- **Solution**: Provide more context in the conversation

---

## Configuration

### Add Custom Trigger Phrases
Edit `bubbleup-doc-capture-config.json`:

```json
{
  "triggers": {
    "design": {
      "patterns": [
        "Design decision:",
        "Your custom phrase here"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Adjust Story ID Patterns
```json
{
  "story_id_patterns": [
    "#(\\d{3})",
    "story (\\d{3})",
    "for story (\\d{3})"
  ]
}
```

## Example Session

```
User: Let's implement story #208

Claude: I'll create the documentation capture agent...
[Builds the feature]
üìù Captured to BubbleUp: Implementation of documentation capture agent

User: How does the pattern recognition work?

Claude: The pattern recognition uses configurable regex...
[Explains technical details]
üìù Captured to BubbleUp: Technical explanation of pattern recognition system

User: What are the next steps?

Claude: Next steps for story #208:
1. Test with real conversations
2. Fine-tune trigger phrases
3. Deploy to production
üìù Captured to BubbleUp: Next steps for story #208
```

**Result**: All three responses captured automatically. Nothing missed.
