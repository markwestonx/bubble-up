  Before implementing these stories, I need to know about the email service for backup notifications. Would you like me to:
  1. Set up email notifications using a service (which one?)
  2. Start implementing the authentication stories?

  Todos
  [ ] Add email notification to backup script for 24 hours
  [ ] Create end-of-day backup summary email after 24 hours
  [√ó] Review stories 126, 133, 127, 123, 122, 124, 125
  [ ] Analyze what's done vs not done for each story
  [ ] Report findings back to user
