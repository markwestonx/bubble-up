# Email Notification Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Gmail Account for Backups

1. Go to https://accounts.google.com/signup
2. Create account:
   - **Email**: `claude.bubble.backups@gmail.com` (or similar)
   - **Password**: Choose a strong password

### Step 2: Enable 2-Factor Authentication

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Click "2-Step Verification"
3. Follow the prompts to enable 2FA

### Step 3: Generate App Password

1. Still in Security settings, scroll to "App passwords"
2. Click "App passwords"
3. Select:
   - **App**: Mail
   - **Device**: Windows Computer (or Other)
4. Click "Generate"
5. **COPY THE 16-CHARACTER PASSWORD** - you'll need this next

### Step 4: Add Credentials to .env.local

Add these lines to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Email Notification Settings
BACKUP_EMAIL_USER=claude.bubble.backups@gmail.com
BACKUP_EMAIL_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx  # The 16-char app password from Step 3
BACKUP_EMAIL_FROM=Claude Backup Bot <claude.bubble.backups@gmail.com>
BACKUP_EMAIL_TO=mark.weston@regulativ.ai
```

**Replace** `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx` with the actual 16-character app password.

### Step 5: Enable Intensive Monitoring

Run this command to enable hourly emails for the next 24 hours:

```bash
node email-notifier.js enable-intensive
```

### Step 6: Test the Setup

Send a test email:

```bash
node email-notifier.js test
```

Check `mark.weston@regulativ.ai` inbox for the test email.

---

## Usage Commands

### Enable/Disable Monitoring Modes

```bash
# Enable hourly emails for next 24 hours
node email-notifier.js enable-intensive

# Switch to end-of-day summary only
node email-notifier.js disable-intensive

# Check current status
node email-notifier.js status
```

### Manual Backup with Email

```bash
npm run backup
```

This will automatically send an email if:
- Intensive mode is enabled (sends every hour)
- OR it's a daily/weekly backup

---

## How It Works

### Intensive Mode (First 24 Hours)

When enabled, you receive an email **after every backup**:
- ‚úÖ Hourly backups (07:00 - 00:00)
- ‚úÖ Daily backup (07:00)
- ‚úÖ Weekly backup (Sunday 07:00)

Email includes:
- Backup type (Son/Father/Grandfather)
- Timestamp
- File size
- Number of stories backed up
- Success/failure status

### Daily Summary Mode (After 24 Hours)

After 24 hours, automatically switches to **one email per day at 6 PM UK time**:
- Summary of all backups that day
- Total data backed up
- Success/failure count
- Next backup time

### Failure Alerts

If a backup fails:
- ‚ùå Immediate email notification (regardless of mode)
- Error details
- Stack trace for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending

1. Check `.env.local` has correct credentials
2. Verify app password (16 characters, no spaces in actual password)
3. Check Gmail account is not locked
4. Look for error messages in console

### Wrong Email Address

Update in `.env.local`:
```bash
BACKUP_EMAIL_TO=your.email@domain.com
```

### Change Email Account

Update both in `.env.local`:
```bash
BACKUP_EMAIL_USER=new.email@gmail.com
BACKUP_EMAIL_PASSWORD=new app password
```

---

## Security Notes

- ‚úÖ App passwords are safer than regular passwords
- ‚úÖ App passwords can be revoked anytime
- ‚úÖ 2FA required for app passwords
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Never commit `.env.local` to git (already in `.gitignore`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Don't share app password

---

## Timeline

**Next 24 Hours**:
- Email after EVERY backup (18 emails/day)
- Helps verify system is working

**After 24 Hours**:
- One email per day at 6 PM
- Summary of all backups
- Failure alerts still immediate

**To Check Anytime**:
```bash
node email-notifier.js status
```
